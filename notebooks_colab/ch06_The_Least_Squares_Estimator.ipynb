    "## Chapter Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the properties of the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimator is fundamental to econometric inference. While Chapter 5 showed *how* to estimate regression models, this chapter explains *why* OLS works and *when* we can trust its results. We examine the statistical properties that make OLS the standard estimation method in econometrics: unbiasedness, efficiency, and asymptotic normality.\n",
    "\n",
    "A crucial concept is the distinction between the **population regression** (the true relationship we want to learn about) and the **sample regression** (our estimate from limited data). Different samples yield different estimates—this sampling variability is inevitable but quantifiable. By understanding how OLS estimates vary across samples, we can construct confidence intervals and test hypotheses about economic relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter uses Monte Carlo simulations and real-world examples to demonstrate OLS properties empirically, connecting abstract statistical theory to tangible patterns in data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Distinguish between the population regression line (β₁ + β₂x) and the sample regression line (b₁ + b₂x)\n",
    "- Understand the conditional mean E[y|x] and the error term u = y - E[y|x]\n",
    "- Differentiate between the unobserved error term (u) and the observed residual (e)\n",
    "- Apply the four key OLS assumptions: correct model, mean-zero errors, homoskedasticity, and independence\n",
    "- Calculate the variance and standard error of the OLS slope coefficient b₂\n",
    "- Explain why b₂ is an unbiased estimator of β₂ under assumptions 1-2\n",
    "- Compute the standard error of the regression (sₑ) and use it to estimate precision\n",
    "- Understand when OLS estimates are more precise (good fit, many observations, scattered regressors)\n",
    "- Apply the Central Limit Theorem to show b₂ is approximately normally distributed for large samples\n",
    "- Recognize that OLS is the Best Linear Unbiased Estimator (BLUE) under standard assumptions\n",
    "- Conduct Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate sampling distributions\n",
    "- Interpret sampling variability and its implications for statistical inference\n",

    "We simulated 1,000 independent samples (each with n=30 observations) from the same DGP: y = 1 + 2x + u. Here are the results:\n",

    "- **Mean of 1,000 estimates**: 0.9960\n",

    "- **Difference from true value**: -0.0056 (only 0.3% error)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What this demonstrates:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Unbiasedness confirmed**: The mean of the estimates (0.9960 for intercept, 1.9944 for slope) is extremely close to the true parameters (1.0 and 2.0). With 1,000 simulations, random errors average out, leaving us essentially at the true values. This is the **unbiasedness property** of OLS: E[b₂] = β₂.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sampling variability quantified**: Individual estimates varied substantially:\n",
    "   - The intercept estimates had a standard deviation of 1.21, meaning about 95% of estimates fell within 1.0 ± 2(1.21) = [-1.42, 3.42]\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Why individual estimates differ from true values**: Any single sample (like Sample 1, 2, or 3 we saw earlier) will contain random errors that cause the estimate to deviate from the true parameter. But these deviations are **random**—sometimes too high, sometimes too low—and average out to zero across many samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Standard deviation as a measure of precision**: The standard deviation of the estimates (0.38 for slope) measures the **sampling variability**. This is closely related to the **standard error** you see in regression output, which estimates this variability from a single sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The big picture**:\n",
    "\n",
    "This simulation proves mathematically that OLS \"works\" in a precise sense: if we could repeat our study infinitely many times, the average of all our estimates would equal the true parameter. Of course, in practice we only get **one sample**, so we use standard errors to acknowledge the uncertainty inherent in any single estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Economic intuition**: Imagine 1,000 different researchers each collecting their own sample of n=30 observations from the same population. Each would report a different regression coefficient. The simulation shows that:\n",

    "- On average, they'd get the right answer (unbiasedness)\n",

    "- The **population regression model** E[y|x] = β₁ + β₂x describes the true relationship with unknown parameters β₁ and β₂\n",
    "- The **conditional mean** E[y|x] generalizes the unconditional mean E[y] by allowing the average to vary with x\n",
    "- The **error term** u = y - E[y|x] captures deviations from the population line; it is unobserved because β₁ and β₂ are unknown\n",
    "- **Crucial distinction**: Error u (deviation from unknown population line) vs. residual e (deviation from estimated sample line)\n",
    "- The **sample regression** ŷ = b₁ + b₂x estimates the population relationship from data\n",
    "- Different samples yield different estimates (b₁, b₂) due to sampling variability, but on average they equal the true parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "### Error Term Properties and Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "- The error term is assumed to have **conditional mean zero**: E[u|x] = 0 (errors average to zero at each x value)\n",
    "- This assumption ensures the population line is indeed E[y|x] = β₁ + β₂x\n",
    "- **Homoskedasticity assumption**: Var[u|x] = σ²ᵤ (constant error variance across all x values)\n",
    "- \"Homoskedastic\" derives from Greek: homos (same) + skedastic (scattering)\n",
    "- The variance Var[y|x] = Var[u|x] = σ²ᵤ measures variability around the population line\n",
    "- Greater error variance means greater noise, reducing precision of estimates\n",
    "\n",
    "### Four Core OLS Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Correct model**: yᵢ = β₁ + β₂xᵢ + uᵢ for all i (linearity)\n",
    "2. **Mean-zero errors**: E[uᵢ|xᵢ] = 0 for all i (no correlation between x and u)\n",
    "3. **Homoskedasticity**: Var[uᵢ|xᵢ] = σ²ᵤ for all i (constant error variance)\n",
    "4. **Independence**: uᵢ and u are independent for all i ≠ j (no autocorrelation)\n",
    "- **Assumptions 1-2 are essential** for unbiasedness and consistency (violations cause bias)\n",
    "- **Assumptions 3-4 can be relaxed** using robust standard errors (Chapter 7.7, 12.1)\n",
    "- Assumption 2 rules out **omitted variable bias** (no correlation between x and u)\n",
    "- Choosing correct standard errors is crucial for valid confidence intervals and hypothesis tests\n",

    "- Since σ²ᵤ is unknown, estimate it using **standard error of regression**: s²ₑ = (1/(n-2)) Σ(yᵢ - ŷᵢ)²\n",

    "### Monte Carlo Simulation Evidence\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Monte Carlo simulations** demonstrate OLS properties empirically by generating many samples from a known model\n",
    "- Two examples: (1) Generated data from y = 1 + 2x + u with u ~ N(0,4), (2) Samples from 1880 Census (1.06 million males aged 60-70)\n",

    "- **Sampling variability is inevitable**: Any single sample will deviate from true parameters\n",
    "- **Standard errors quantify uncertainty**: They measure the typical deviation of b₂ from β₂ across hypothetical repeated samples\n",
    "- **Confidence intervals account for uncertainty**: A 95% CI constructed as b₂ ± 2×se(b₂) will contain β₂ in 95% of samples\n",
    "- **Assumptions 1-2 are non-negotiable** for unbiasedness; violations cause bias and inconsistency (Chapter 16 discusses, Chapter 17 presents solutions)\n",
    "- **Assumptions 3-4 are often relaxed** in practice using robust standard errors (Chapters 7.7, 12.1)\n",
    "- **Correct standard errors are crucial**: Incorrect SEs invalidate confidence intervals and hypothesis tests\n",

    "**Instructions:** The standard error of b₂ can be calculated two ways: (1) using the theoretical formula with sample data, (2) using the standard deviation of estimates across many samples (Monte Carlo).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your task:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Theoretical SE**: Take any single sample of n=50, estimate the regression, and extract se(b₂) from the regression output\n",
    "2. **Empirical SE**: Use the standard deviation of the 1,000 b₂ estimates from Task 3\n",
    "3. Compare the two: Are they similar? Why or why not?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The theoretical SE comes from the formula: se(b₂) = sₑ / √[Σ(xᵢ - x̄)²]\n",
    "- The empirical SE is: std(b₂ estimates from 1,000 samples)\n",
    "- They should be close but not identical (theoretical SE is an estimate, empirical SE is the \"true\" sampling variability in this simulation)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Discussion questions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- In real-world research, do we have access to the empirical SE? Why or why not?\n",
    "- Why is the theoretical SE useful if we can only draw one sample?\n"

    "#### Task 5: Investigate the Effect of Sample Size (Independent)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:** Theory predicts that standard errors decrease with sample size n according to the relationship se(b₂) ∝ 1/√n. Test this prediction by comparing sampling distributions for different sample sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your task:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run Monte Carlo simulations (1,000 iterations each) for three sample sizes: n = 20, n = 50, n = 80\n",
    "2. For each sample size, calculate the standard deviation of b₂ estimates\n",
    "3. Create side-by-side histograms of the three sampling distributions\n",
    "4. Verify the theoretical relationship: Does se(b₂) decrease roughly as 1/√n?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis questions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you double the sample size from n=50 to n=100, how much does the standard error decrease?\n",
    "- What does this imply about the \"cost\" of precision in empirical research?\n",
    "- Would you prefer a study with n=50 or n=80? How much more precise is the larger sample?\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Key Concept 6.10: Standard Errors and Sample Size**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Standard errors decrease with the square root of sample size: se(b₂) = σᵤ / √[n × Var(x)]. This means to halve the standard error, you need **four times** the sample size. This fundamental relationship guides study design—small increases in sample size yield diminishing returns in precision. The implication: going from n=100 to n=400 has the same effect on precision as going from n=25 to n=100.\n"

    "\n",
    "- **Experienced firsthand** how OLS estimates vary across samples using real economic data (not just simulated data)\n",
    "- **Verified empirically** that the theoretical standard error formula accurately predicts sampling variability\n",
    "- **Discovered** how sample size affects estimation precision in practice (se ∝ 1/√n)\n",
    "- **Explored** whether sampling variability differs across subpopulations (high-income vs. developing countries)\n",
    "- **Connected** abstract statistical theory (unbiasedness, CLT, standard errors) to tangible empirical patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key insights:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Unbiasedness in action**: The average of many sample estimates equals the population parameter, even though individual estimates vary\n",
    "2. **Standard errors quantify uncertainty**: The spread of the sampling distribution tells us how much confidence to place in any single estimate\n",
    "3. **Sample size matters**: Larger samples yield more precise estimates, but with diminishing returns (√n relationship)\n",
    "4. **Context matters**: Sampling variability may differ across subpopulations, affecting the generalizability of findings\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next steps:** In Chapter 7, you'll use these standard errors to construct confidence intervals and test hypotheses about regression coefficients—the foundation of statistical inference in econometrics.\n",
