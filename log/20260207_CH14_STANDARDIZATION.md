## Changes Made

### Phase 0: Remove Emojis
- Removed emojis from 4 cells (10, 15, 17, 24)

### Phase 1: Structure and Learning Objectives
- Enhanced Chapter Overview (cell 1) with 10 formal learning objectives from notes
- Added chapter outline listing sections 14.1-14.5 + Key Takeaways, Practice Exercises, Case Studies
- Kept existing dataset description in bulleted list format

### Phase 2: Key Concept Boxes (10 total: 8 main + 2 in case study)
1. Indicator Variables and Difference in Means (after Model 1 regression)
2. Regression vs. Specialized Test Methods (after t-test comparison)
3. Interaction Terms Between Indicators and Continuous Variables (after Models 2-5)
4. Joint Significance Testing for Indicator Variables (after model comparison)
5. Testing for Structural Change (after separate regressions)
6. The Dummy Variable Trap (after sets of indicators code)
7. ANOVA as Regression on Indicators (after ANOVA)
8. Visualizing Group Differences in Regression (after visualizations)
9. Regional Indicators as Difference in Means (case study)
10. Interaction Terms for Regional Heterogeneity (case study)

### Phase 3: Transition Notes (3)
- Between 14.1 and 14.2: single indicator -> adding continuous controls
- Between 14.3 and 14.4: interaction terms -> structural change testing
- Between 14.5 and Visualizations: statistical framework -> graphical visualization

### Phase 4: Key Takeaways
- Replaced Chapter Summary with template-formatted Key Takeaways
- 6 thematic groups: Basics, Single Indicator, Controls and Interactions, Dummy Variable Trap, Hypothesis Testing, General Lessons
- Python tools, next steps, congratulations closing

### Phase 5: Practice Exercises (6)
1. Interpreting Indicator Regression
2. Constructing from Means
3. Multiple Indicators
4. Changing Base Category
5. Interaction Interpretation
6. Joint F-Test

### Phase 6: Case Studies (Mendez dataset)
- Case Study: Regional Indicator Variables for Cross-Country Productivity
- 6 progressive tasks (Guided -> Independent):
  1. Create Regional Indicators and Compute Means (Guided)
  2. Regression on Regional Indicators (Guided)
  3. Add Continuous Controls (Semi-guided)
  4. Regional Interactions (Semi-guided)
  5. Joint F-Tests for Regional Effects (Independent)
  6. Policy Brief on Regional Disparities (Independent)
