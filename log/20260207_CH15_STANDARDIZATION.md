## Changes Made

### Phase 0: Remove Emojis
- Removed emojis from 5 cells (10, 17, 26, 32, 39)

### Phase 1: Structure and Learning Objectives
- Enhanced Chapter Overview (cell 1) with 8 formal learning objectives from notes
- Added chapter outline listing sections 15.2-15.7 + Key Takeaways, Practice Exercises, Case Studies

### Phase 2: Key Concept Boxes (10 total: 8 main + 2 in case study)
1. Log Transformations and Coefficient Interpretation (after log models)
2. Choosing Between Model Specifications (after model comparison)
3. Quadratic Models and Turning Points (after turning point calculation)
4. Testing Nonlinear Relationships (after joint hypothesis test)
5. Standardized Coefficients for Comparing Variable Importance (after standardized calc)
6. Interaction Terms and Varying Marginal Effects (after interaction models)
7. Retransformation Bias Correction (after retransformation demo)
8. Models with Mixed Regressor Types (after comprehensive model)
9. Nonlinear Returns to Human Capital (case study)
10. Heterogeneous Returns Across Regions (case study)

### Phase 3: Transition Notes (3)
- Between 15.2 and 15.3: log transformations -> polynomial models
- Between 15.4 and 15.5: standardized coefficients -> interaction terms
- Between retransformation and comprehensive model

### Phase 4: Key Takeaways
- Replaced Chapter Summary with 6 thematic groups
- Python tools, next steps, congratulations closing

### Phase 5: Practice Exercises (6)
1. Marginal Effect of Quadratic
2. Interaction Marginal Effect
3. Retransformation Prediction
4. Log Model Interpretation
5. Standardized Coefficient Ranking
6. Model Selection

### Phase 6: Case Studies (Mendez dataset)
- Case Study: Transformed Variables for Cross-Country Productivity Analysis
- 6 progressive tasks (Guided -> Independent)
