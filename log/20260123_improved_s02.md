**Added Key Concept boxes after major sections (6 total):**
1. After Section 2.1: Summary statistics and distribution measures
2. After Section 2.2: Histograms and visualizations
3. After Section 2.3: Bar charts and spatial maps
4. After Section 2.4: Categorical data and pie charts
5. After Section 2.5: Log transformations and z-scores
6. After Section 2.6: Time series transformations

### 5. Added Consolidated Key Takeaways

**Created 3 thematic groups at chapter end:**

**Group 1: Summary Statistics and Data Distributions (6 bullets)**
- Summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, quartiles)
- Mean vs. median for skewed data
- Standard deviation interpretation (68%-95%-99.7% rule)
- Skewness (asymmetry measure)
- Kurtosis (tail heaviness measure)
- Box plots (visual summary)

**Group 2: Visualizations for Different Data Types (6 bullets)**
- Histograms and bin width
- Kernel density estimates
- Line charts for time series
- Bar charts for categorical data
- Pie charts for proportions
- Spatial maps for geographic data

**Group 3: Data Transformations and Their Applications (7 bullets)**
- Natural logarithm for right-skewed data
- Z-scores for standardization
- Moving averages for smoothing
- Seasonal adjustment
- Real vs. nominal adjustments
- Per capita adjustments
- Growth rates and percentage changes

**Total: 19 Key Takeaways bullets**

## Template Consistency

### Pattern Followed (from s01)

✅ **Learning Objectives Format:**
- "By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:"
- Action-oriented bullets (maintained existing 6 bullets)

✅ **Heading Hierarchy:**
- Level 1: Chapter title
- Level 2: Learning Objectives, sections (2.1-2.8), Key Takeaways
- Level 3: Subsections (2.1.1-2.6.3)

✅ **Key Concept Format:**
- `> **Key Concept**: [2-3 sentence explanation]`
- Placed after each major section (2.1-2.6)

✅ **Key Takeaways Format:**
- Consolidated at chapter end
- 3 thematic groups with bold headers
- 5-7 bullets per group
- Total: 19 bullets

✅ **Visual Separators:**
- Strategic use of `---` (only 3 per document)
- After Learning Objectives, before/after Key Takeaways
