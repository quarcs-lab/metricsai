## Changes Made

### Phase 0: Remove Emojis
- Removed emojis from 5 cells (9, 17, 21, 28, 34)

### Phase 1: Structure and Learning Objectives
- Enhanced Chapter Overview (cell 1) with 9 formal learning objectives from notes
- Added chapter outline listing sections 16.1-16.8 + Key Takeaways, Practice Exercises, Case Studies
- Datasets in bulleted list format

### Phase 2: Key Concept Boxes (10 total: 8 main + 2 in case study)
1. Multicollinearity and the Variance Inflation Factor (after VIF calculation)
2. Joint Hypothesis Tests Under Multicollinearity (after joint tests)
3. Consequences of OLS Assumption Violations (after assumptions code)
4. Heteroskedasticity and Robust Standard Errors (after SE comparison)
5. Autocorrelation and HAC Standard Errors (after ACF residuals)
6. Omitted Variables Bias in Practice (after multiple regression)
7. Diagnostic Plots for Model Validation (after Figure 16.3)
8. Influential Observations -- DFITS and DFBETAS (after DFBETAS plot)
9. Systematic Regression Diagnostics (case study)
10. Cross-Country Regression Challenges (case study)

### Phase 3: Transition Notes (3)
- Between 16.1 and 16.2-16.4: multicollinearity -> OLS assumptions
- Between 16.6 and 16.7: theory -> real-world application
- Between 16.8 plots and DFITS: visual diagnostics -> numerical measures

### Phase 4: Key Takeaways
- Replaced Chapter Summary with 6 thematic groups
- Python tools, next steps, congratulations closing

### Phase 5: Practice Exercises (6)
1. Irrelevant Variables vs. Omitted Variables
2. VIF Interpretation
3. Choosing Standard Error Types
4. Heteroskedasticity Detection
5. DFITS Threshold Calculation
6. Autocorrelation Consequences

### Phase 6: Case Studies (Mendez dataset)
- Case Study: Regression Diagnostics for Cross-Country Productivity Analysis
- 6 progressive tasks (Guided -> Independent)
