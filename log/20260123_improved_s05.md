## Work Completed

### File Improved
- **File:** `notes/s05 Bivariate Data Summary.md`
- **Size change:** ~40 KB → ~41 KB (+1 KB)
- **Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## Improvements Applied

### 1. Removed Redundant Content

**Removed introductory text after Learning Objectives:**
- Deleted 9 lines of descriptive text explaining chapter structure
- Deleted thematic preview paragraphs (Visualization and Association, Regression Analysis, Model Evaluation, Advanced Topics)
- Learning Objectives now followed immediately by visual separator

**Removed Outline section:**
- Deleted numbered outline listing 12 topics
- Deleted dataset reference (HOUSE)
- Section headings provide sufficient structure

### 2. Fixed Heading Hierarchy

**Changed all section headings from ### to ##:**
- 5.1 Example: House Price and Size
- 5.2 Two-way Tabulation
- 5.3 Two-way Scatterplot
- 5.4 Sample Correlation
- 5.5 Regression Line
- 5.6 Measures of Model Fit
- 5.7 Computer Output following OLS Regression
- 5.8 Prediction
- 5.9 Regression and Correlation
- 5.10 Causation
- 5.11 Computations for Correlation and Regression
- 5.12 Nonparametric Regression

**Note:** Subsections within each section maintained their hierarchy level

### 3. Added Visual Separators

**Strategic placement (3 total):**
- After Learning Objectives (before content)
- Before Key Takeaways (after content)
- After Key Takeaways (end of document)

### 4. Consolidated Key Concepts

**Removed dispersed Key Takeaways sections (3 total):**
- "Key Takeaways from Sections 5.1-5.4 (Visualization and Correlation)" - 6 bullets
- "Key Takeaways from Sections 5.5-5.7 (Regression Analysis)" - 7 bullets
- "Key Takeaways from Section 5.6 (Model Fit) and Sections 5.8-5.9" - 8 bullets

**Added Key Concept boxes after major sections (10 total):**
1. After Section 5.1: House price and size data, visual inspection
2. After Section 5.2: Two-way tabulations and chi-squared tests
3. After Section 5.3: Scatterplots for visualization
4. After Section 5.4: Correlation coefficient and autocorrelation
5. After Section 5.5: Regression line and least squares
6. After Section 5.6: R-squared and model fit
7. After Section 5.7: Computer regression output
8. After Section 5.8: Prediction and outliers
9. After Section 5.9: Connection between regression and correlation
10. After Section 5.10: Causation vs. association, regression asymmetry
11. After Section 5.11: Manual computation formulas
12. After Section 5.12: Nonparametric regression

### 5. Added Consolidated Key Takeaways

**Created 4 thematic groups at chapter end:**

**Group 1: Visualization and Correlation (7 bullets)**
- Two-way tabulations, scatterplots, correlation basics
- Chi-squared tests for categorical data
- Covariance vs. correlation
- House price-size correlation (r = 0.786)
- Autocorrelation for time series

**Group 2: Regression Analysis and Interpretation (8 bullets)**
- OLS estimation and least squares
- Slope interpretation (b₂ = 73.77 for house prices)
- Intercept meaning
- Residuals and prediction errors
- Regression on intercept only yields sample mean
- Formulas for b₂ and b₁
- Connection: b₂ = rₓᵧ × (sᵧ/sₓ)

**Group 3: Model Fit and Evaluation (8 bullets)**
- R-squared definition and interpretation
- R² formulas (explained SS / total SS)
- R² = r²ₓᵧ for bivariate regression
- House prices: R² = 0.618
- Standard error of regression
- Low R² doesn't mean uninformative
- Computer output interpretation

**Group 4: Prediction, Causation, and Extensions (9 bullets)**
- Prediction using ŷ = b₁ + b₂x*
- In-sample vs. out-of-sample prediction
- Outliers and their influence
- Association ≠ causation
- Confounding variables
- Regression asymmetry
- Reverse regression slopes not reciprocals
- Manual computation formulas
- Nonparametric regression methods

**Total: 32 Key Takeaways bullets**

- Action-oriented bullets (maintained existing 8 bullets)

✅ **Heading Hierarchy:**
- Level 1: Chapter title
- Level 2: Learning Objectives, sections (5.1-5.12), Key Takeaways
- Level 3: Subsections where present

✅ **Key Concept Format:**
- `> **Key Concept**: [2-3 sentence explanation]`
- Placed after each major section (5.1-5.12)

✅ **Key Takeaways Format:**
- Consolidated at chapter end
- 4 thematic groups with bold headers
- 7-9 bullets per group
- Total: 32 bullets

✅ **Visual Separators:**
- Strategic use of `---` (only 3 per document)
- After Learning Objectives, before/after Key Takeaways
