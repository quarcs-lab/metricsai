- Calculus foundation and percentage interpretation
- Examples with x₀ = 40, x₁ = 40.4

**9.2 Semi-elasticity and Elasticity:**
- Semi-elasticity: (Δy/y)/Δx - percentage change per unit change
- Elasticity: (Δy/y)/(Δx/x) - percentage per percentage change
- Examples: earnings-education, price elasticity of demand
- Logarithmic approximations for regression estimation
- OLS estimation methods for each measure

**9.3 Log-linear, Log-log, and Linear-log Models:**
- Log-linear: ln y on x, coefficient = semi-elasticity
- Log-log: ln y on ln x, coefficient = elasticity
- Linear-log: y on ln x, coefficient/100 = level change per 1% change in x
- Comparison table showing all four model types
- Domain requirements and when to use each

**9.4 Example: Earnings and Education:**
- EARNINGS dataset: 171 male workers aged 30 (2010)
- Linear model: +$5,021 per year of education (R² = 0.289)
- Log-linear: +13.1% per year (R² = 0.334, best fit)
- Log-log: +1.478% per 1% education increase (R² = 0.286)

- Linearizing exponential growth: x_t = x₀(1+r)^t becomes ln x_t ≈ ln x₀ + r×t
- S&P 500 example (1927-2019): ~6.5% annual growth estimated from log plot

**9.6 Exponential Function:**
- Definition: exp(x) = e^x as inverse of ln
- Taylor series: e^x = 1 + x + x²/2! + x³/3! + ...
