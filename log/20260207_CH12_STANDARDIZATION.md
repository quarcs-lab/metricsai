## Changes Made

### Phase 0: Duplicate Cell Cleanup
- Removed 8 duplicate interpretation cells (emoji boxes that appeared twice)
- Reduced from 47 to 39 cells before standardization

### Phase 1: Structure & Learning Objectives
- Enhanced Chapter Overview (cell 1) with 8 formal learning objectives from notes
- Added chapter outline listing sections 12.2-12.7 + Key Takeaways, Practice Exercises, Case Studies

### Phase 2: Key Concept Boxes (10 total: 8 main + 2 in case study)
1. Heteroskedastic-Robust Standard Errors (after HC1 code)
2. HAC Standard Errors for Time Series (after correlogram code)
3. Predicting Conditional Means vs. Individual Outcomes (after prediction code)
4. Why Individual Forecasts Are Imprecise (after robust prediction code)
5. Sample Selection Bias (after nonrepresentative samples code)
6. Feasible Generalized Least Squares (after best estimation code)
7. Bootstrap Confidence Intervals (in best CIs section)
8. Type I and Type II Errors (in best tests section)
9. Choosing the Right Standard Errors (case study)
10. Robust Methods Don't Fix Everything (case study)

### Phase 3: Transition Notes (3)
- Between 12.2 and 12.3: robust SEs → prediction
- Between 12.4 and 12.5: sample selection → best estimation
- Between 12.6 and 12.7: best CIs → best tests

### Phase 4: Key Takeaways
- Replaced Chapter Summary with template-formatted Key Takeaways
- 6 thematic groups: Robust SEs, Prediction, Nonrepresentative Samples, Best Estimation, Best CIs, Best Tests

### Phase 5: Practice Exercises (6)
1. Choosing Standard Errors
2. Point Prediction
3. Conditional Mean CI
4. Individual Forecast CI
5. Robust vs. Default Inference
6. Type I/II Error Tradeoff

### Phase 6: Case Studies (Mendez dataset)
- Case Study: Robust Inference for Cross-Country Productivity
- 6 progressive tasks (Guided → Independent):
  1. Default vs. Robust SEs (Guided)
  2. Cluster-Robust SEs by Region (Guided)
  3. Predict Conditional Mean (Semi-guided)
  4. Forecast Individual Country (Semi-guided)
  5. Model Comparison with Robust Inference (Independent)
  6. Policy Brief on Inference Robustness (Independent)
