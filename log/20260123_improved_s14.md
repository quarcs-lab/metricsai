### 4. Maintained Key Concept Boxes

**Kept all existing Key Concept boxes (11 total):**
1. After 14.1: Definition and examples of indicator variables in EARNINGS_COMPLETE dataset
2. After 14.2.1: Regression on single indicator = difference in means (women earn $16,396 less)
3. After 14.2.2: Specialized t-test methods vs. regression (same estimate, different SE)
4. After 14.3.1: Interacted indicators allow slopes to vary by group
5. After 14.3.2: Indicator-only (parallel lines) vs. indicator+interaction (non-parallel lines)
6. After 14.3.3: Joint F-tests for indicator and interaction (gender effect varies with education)
7. After 14.3.4: Indicator as dependent variable (logit/probit preferred over OLS)
8. After 14.4.2: Dummy variable trap explanation (perfect multicollinearity)
9. After 14.4.3: Base category interpretation (coefficients measure differences from omitted category)
10. After 14.4.4: t-tests vs. F-tests for indicator sets (F-test invariant to base choice)
11. After 14.4.6: Regression on indicators = ANOVA (no significant differences without controls)

### 5. Added Consolidated Key Takeaways

**Created 9 thematic groups at chapter end:**

**Group 1: Indicator Variables Basics (6 bullets)**
- Binary variables (1 for category, 0 otherwise)
- Incorporate categorical information (gender, employment, region)
- Unordered or ordered categorical variables
- EARNINGS_COMPLETE dataset examples
- Ubiquitous in applied econometrics
- Interpretation differs from continuous variables

**Group 2: Regression on a Single Indicator and Difference in Means (9 bullets)**
- Fitted model: $\hat{y} = b + ad$ where $b = \bar{y}_0$, $a = \bar{y}_1 - \bar{y}_0$
- Equivalent to two-sample difference-in-means test
- t-statistic tests whether group means differ
- Specialized t-test methods vs. regression (same estimate, different SE)
- Regression more flexible for adding controls
- Example: Women earn $16,396 less ($t=-4.71$)
- Both approaches valid
- Regression uses model SE; t-test uses pooled SE formula
- Statistical equivalence of methods

**Group 3: Indicators with Continuous Regressors (7 bullets)**
- Adding $d$ to model with $x$: measures group difference after controlling for $x$
- Enables testing whether group differences persist after controls
- Example: Gender gap after controlling for education
- Including only $d$ shifts intercept (parallel lines)
- Fitted values differ by constant across groups
- Parallel lines assumption: effect of $x$ same in both groups
- Controls can reveal or explain group differences

**Group 4: Interaction Terms Between Indicators and Continuous Variables (9 bullets)**
- Interacted indicator: product $d \times x$
- Interaction coefficient measures how slope differs between groups
- Slopes: $(\beta_2 + \alpha_2)$ if $d=1$, $\beta_2$ if $d=0$
- Allows both intercepts and slopes to vary (non-parallel lines)
- Example: Gender gap varies with education (interaction = -2,765)
- Always use joint F-tests for indicator and interaction
- Joint F-test: $H_0: \beta_{\text{gender}}=0, \beta_{\text{gender×education}}=0$
- Example F-test: $F=31.92$ ($p=0.000$), strong rejection
- If $y$ is indicator, logit/probit preferred over OLS

**Group 5: Sets of Mutually Exclusive Indicators (6 bullets)**
- Mutually exclusive: each observation in exactly one category
- Only one indicator equals 1, others equal 0: $d_1 + d_2 + d_3 = 1$
- Examples: worker type, region, education level
- Can be unordered or ordered categorical variables
- Must avoid dummy variable trap
- Common in empirical applications

**Group 6: Dummy Variable Trap and Base Category (9 bullets)**
- Dummy variable trap: including all $C$ indicators plus intercept
- Creates perfect multicollinearity ($C+1$ parameters, $C$ identifiable)
- Solution: Drop one indicator (base category) or drop intercept
- Standard practice: Keep intercept, drop one indicator
- Base category = reference group for comparisons
- Coefficients measure differences from base after controlling for other regressors
- Choice of base arbitrary (doesn't affect conclusions)
- Example: Self-employed omitted, coefficients show differences from self-employed
- Interpretation changes with base choice, but inferences invariant

**Group 7: Hypothesis Testing with Indicator Sets (8 bullets)**
- t-test on single indicator: tests if that category differs from base ($H_0: \alpha_j = \alpha_{\text{base}}$)
- NOT a test of $\alpha_j = 0$ (unless intercept dropped)
- F-test on all $C-1$ indicators: tests overall significance ($H_0: \alpha_1 = \cdots = \alpha_C$)
- F-test result identical regardless of base category choice
- Always use F-tests for categorical variable significance
- Regression on indicators (no controls) = ANOVA
- Example: No significant differences without controls ($F=1.68$, $p=0.188$)
- Adding controls reveals significant differences ($F=2.01$)

**Group 8: Regression Results Invariance (6 bullets)**
- Coefficients on continuous variables unchanged regardless of dropped indicator
- F-statistic for indicator set identical across base choices
- Only indicator coefficients and intercept change interpretation
- $R^2$ differs when dropping intercept (not comparable)
- Table 14.3 demonstrates invariance across specifications
- Statistical conclusions robust to base category choice

**Group 9: General Lessons from Indicator Variable Regressions (7 bullets)**
- Indicators enable group comparisons while controlling for factors
- Provide flexibility for categorical relationships in regression
- Proper interpretation requires knowing base category
- Joint F-tests essential for multi-category variables
- Interactions allow relationships to vary by group
- Always use heteroskedastic-robust standard errors
- Regression unifies many tests (t-tests, ANOVA) in single framework
- EARNINGS_COMPLETE: 872 workers, significant gender gaps varying with education

**Total: 67 Key Takeaways bullets**

## Chapter 14 Coverage

**Section 14.1: Example Data**
- EARNINGS_COMPLETE dataset: 872 workers (full-time, aged 25-65, year 2000)
- Variables: Earnings, Age, Gender (1=female), Education, Hours
- Indicator variables: Gender, d1 (self-employed), d2 (private sector), d3 (government sector)
- Interaction variables: Gender×Education, Gender×Age, Gender×Hours
- Summary statistics for all variables

**Section 14.2: Regression on a Single Indicator Variable**
- Definition: Indicator $d=1$ if in category, $d=0$ otherwise
- Fitted model: $\hat{y} = b + ad$ where $b = \bar{y}_0$, $a = \bar{y}_1 - \bar{y}_0$
- Regression on indicator = difference in means test
- Example: Women earn \$16,396 less than men ($t=-4.71$, highly significant)
- Comparison with specialized t-test methods (same estimate, different SE)
- Regression SE from model; t-test SE = $\sqrt{s_1^2/n_1 + s_0^2/n_0}$

**Section 14.3: Indicators with Additional Regressors**
- Model: $y = \beta_1 + \beta_2 x + \alpha d + u$
- Indicator coefficient measures group difference after controlling for $x$
- Interacted indicators: $d \times x$ allows slopes to vary by group
- Model with interaction: $y = \beta_1 + \beta_2 x + \alpha_1 d + \alpha_2(d \times x) + u$
- Graphical comparison: indicator-only (parallel lines) vs. indicator+interaction (non-parallel)
- Example: Gender gap varies with education (interaction = -2,765, $t=-2.37$)
- Joint F-test for gender and interaction: $F=31.92$ ($p=0.000$)
- Indicator as dependent variable: OLS possible but logit/probit preferred

**Section 14.4: Sets of Indicator Variables**
- Mutually exclusive indicators: each observation in exactly one category
- Example: Three worker types (d1=self-employed, d2=private, d3=government)
- Dummy variable trap: Cannot include all $C$ indicators plus intercept (perfect multicollinearity)
- Solution: Drop one indicator (base category) or drop intercept
- Base category interpretation: Coefficients measure differences from omitted category
- Hypothesis testing: t-tests (category vs. base), F-tests (overall significance)
- F-test invariant to base category choice
- Example: Regression on all three indicators (no intercept) gives group means
- Example: No significant differences without controls ($F=1.68$, $p=0.188$)
- Adding controls (age, education) reveals significant differences ($F=2.01$)
- Regression on indicators (no controls) = ANOVA

**Section 14.5: Key Stata Commands**
- Dataset loading and basic commands
- Regression with robust standard errors
- t-test for difference in means
- Regression with indicators and interactions
- Regression without intercept

**Section 14.6: Exercises**
- 4 exercises on indicator variable interpretation and regression
