## Changes Made

### Phase 1: Structure & Learning Objectives
- Enhanced Chapter Overview (cell 1) with 8 formal learning objectives from notes
- Added chapter outline listing all sections (10.1-10.8 + Key Takeaways, Practice Exercises, Case Studies)
- Kept existing "What you'll learn", "Dataset used" sections

### Phase 2: Key Concept Boxes (10 total: 8 main + 2 in case study)
1. Partial Effects vs. Total Effects in Multiple Regression (after bivariate vs multiple comparison)
2. Exploratory Data Analysis with Scatterplot Matrices (after scatterplot matrix)
3. Correlation vs. Causation in Multivariate Analysis (after correlation heatmap)
4. Interpreting Partial Effects in Multiple Regression (after CI table)
5. The Frisch-Waugh-Lovell (FWL) Theorem (after FWL demonstration)
6. Model Selection with Adjusted R-squared vs. Information Criteria (after AIC/BIC)
7. The Parsimony Principle (after model comparison)
8. Detecting Multicollinearity with VIF (after VIF calculation)
9. Functional Form and Cross-Country Comparisons (case study)
10. Multiple Regression in Development Economics (case study)

### Phase 3: Transition Notes (3)
- Between 10.3 and 10.4: correlation analysis → formal regression estimation
- Between 10.5 and 10.6: partial effects/FWL → model fit evaluation
- Between 10.7 and 10.8: model comparison → multicollinearity pitfall

### Phase 4: Key Takeaways
- Replaced Chapter Summary with template-formatted Key Takeaways
- 6 thematic groups: Data Exploration, OLS Estimation, Partial Effects, Model Fit, Information Criteria, Multicollinearity
- Python tools, next steps, congratulations closing

### Phase 5: Practice Exercises (6)
1. Residuals and Fitted Values
2. Partial vs. Total Effects
3. R-squared and Adjusted R-squared
4. Information Criteria
5. Multicollinearity Detection
6. Model Building

### Phase 6: Case Studies (Mendez dataset)
- Case Study: Multiple Regression for Cross-Country Productivity
- Dataset: Mendez Convergence Clubs (108 countries, 1990-2014)
- 6 progressive tasks (Guided → Independent):
  1. Explore Productivity Data (Guided)
  2. Correlation Analysis (Guided)
  3. Multiple Regression Estimation (Semi-guided)
  4. Interpret Partial Effects (Semi-guided)
  5. Model Selection (Independent)
  6. Development Policy Brief (Independent)
- 2 embedded Key Concepts
- "What You've Learned" closing

## Final Metrics

| Metric | Before | After | Target |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Compliance score | 44/100 | 100/100 | 85-93 |
| Total cells | 35 | 58 | 45-75 |
| Markdown cells | 19 (54%) | 42 (72%) | 70-80% |
| Key Concepts | 0 | 10 | 7-11 |
| Practice Exercises | 0 | 6 | 6-10 |
| Case Study tasks | 0 | 6 | 6 |
| Transition notes | 0 | 3 | 2-4 |

## Remaining Minor Issues (false positives)

1. "Integrated case study structure" — False positive; sections 10.1-10.8 are standard content (4 early sections with minor ≤ 4 triggers the flag)

## Process Notes

- **Exceeded target:** 100/100 vs. target 85-93 (best score of all standardized chapters)
- **Improvement:** +56 points (second-largest improvement after CH09's +57)
- **Key success factors:**
  - Applied all lessons from CH09: no section numbers on back matter, #### for task headers, transitions under 200 chars
  - Used notes/s10 for accurate learning objectives and key concepts
  - Mendez dataset case study maintains consistency across chapters
  - Single Python script handled all insertions bottom-to-top (no cell-shifting errors)
