## Chapter 7 Content Coverage

**Section 7.1: Example - House Price and Size**
- Regression output interpretation (coefficients, standard errors, t-statistics, p-values, confidence intervals)
- House price example: b₂ = 73.77, se(b₂) = 11.17, t = 6.60, p = 0.000
- 95% confidence interval (50.84, 96.70)
- Understanding regression output components

**Section 7.2: The t-Statistic**
- T-statistic formula: T = (b₂ - β₂)/se(b₂) ~ T(n-2)
- Why use T(n-2) instead of N(0,1): because σ²ᵤ is unknown
- Four key OLS assumptions (correct model, mean-zero errors, homoskedasticity, independence)
- T(n-2) is exact under normality, otherwise an approximation

**Section 7.3: Confidence Intervals**
- General formula: b₂ ± t_{n-2,α/2} × se(b₂)
- Approximate 95% CI: b₂ ± 2 × se(b₂)
- Common confidence levels: 90%, 95%, 99%
- Interpretation: 95% of such intervals contain true β₂

**Section 7.4: Tests of Statistical Significance**
- Test H₀: β₂ = 0 against H_a: β₂ ≠ 0
- Test statistic: t = b₂/se(b₂)
- P-value approach and critical value approach
- Economic vs. statistical significance
- Tests using correlation coefficient (weaknesses)

**Section 7.5: Two-Sided Hypothesis Tests**
- General test: H₀: β₂ = β₂* against H_a: β₂ ≠ β₂*
- Test statistic: t = (b₂ - β₂*)/se(b₂)
- P-value: p = Pr[|T_{n-2}| > |t|]
- Critical value: c = t_{n-2,α/2}
- Relationship to confidence intervals

**Section 7.6: One-Sided Hypothesis Tests**
- Upper tail: H₀: β₂ ≤ β₂* vs. H_a: β₂ > β₂*
- Lower tail: H₀: β₂ ≥ β₂* vs. H_a: β₂ < β₂*
- Claim goes in alternative hypothesis
- Different rejection regions (one tail not two)
- Using computer output for one-sided tests

**Section 7.7: Robust Standard Errors**
- Default vs. robust standard errors
- Heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors (relax assumption 3)
- HAC robust (for time series)
- Cluster-robust (for grouped data)
- Simulation example showing heteroskedastic errors

## Key Econometric Concepts Covered

### Fundamental Statistical Inference
- The t-statistic as foundation for regression inference
- T(n-2) distribution vs. N(0,1)
- Degrees of freedom in bivariate regression (n-2)
- Standard error as estimated standard deviation of estimator

### Confidence Intervals
- 100(1-α)% confidence interval formula
- Critical values from t distribution
- Interpretation of confidence intervals
- Tradeoff between confidence level and interval width

### Hypothesis Testing
- Two-sided tests (β₂ ≠ β₂*)
- One-sided tests (β₂ > β₂* or β₂ < β₂*)
- P-value approach vs. critical value approach
- Type I errors and significance levels
- Relationship between tests and confidence intervals

### Statistical Significance
- Test of H₀: β₂ = 0 (no relationship)
- Statistical significance vs. economic significance
- Large samples can find statistical significance for economically insignificant effects
- Importance of assessing both types of significance

### Robust Standard Errors
- Relaxing homoskedasticity assumption (assumption 3)
- Heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors
- Modern econometric practice: use robust SEs by default
- Choice of robust SE method depends on data structure

### Four Key Assumptions
- Assumption 1: Correct model (y = β₁ + β₂x + u)
- Assumption 2: Mean-zero errors (E[uᵢ|xᵢ] = 0)
- Assumption 3: Homoskedasticity (Var[uᵢ|xᵢ] = σ²ᵤ)
- Assumption 4: Independence (uᵢ independent of uⱼ)

## Technical Implementation

### Heading Hierarchy Fix
Used batch sed command to fix all headings efficiently:

```bash
# First change main sections from ### to ##
s/^### 7\.1 /## 7.1 /
s/^### 7\.2 /## 7.2 /
# ... (7 total main sections)

# Then change subsections from ## to ###
s/^## Example (continued)$/### Example (continued)/
s/^## Why use the T(n-2) Distribution?$/### Why use the T(n-2) Distribution?/
# ... (17 total subsections)
```

Result: All main sections at Level 2, all subsections at Level 3.
