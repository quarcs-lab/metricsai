## Major Change: Book Moved to Separate Repository

### What Happened
- **Book content removed** from this repository and moved to a separate dedicated repository
- This allows for better separation of concerns and cleaner repository management

### New Repository Focus

This repository (`metricsai`) will now serve **two primary purposes**:

1. **Website Development & Maintenance**
   - [index.html](../index.html) - Modern web interface (Tailwind CSS)
   - Interactive chapter navigation
   - Colab badge links
   - AI resources integration (slides, videos, quizzes)
   - Responsive design and user experience

2. **Code & Notebooks Maintenance**
   - [code_python/](../code_python/) - 17 Python scripts + educational reports
   - [notebooks_colab/](../notebooks_colab/) - 16 Google Colab notebooks
   - [code_r/](../code_r/) - R reference implementations
   - [code_stata/](../code_stata/) - Stata reference implementations
   - [data/](../data/) - 66 Stata datasets
   - [images/](../images/) - Chapter visualizations
   - [notes/](../notes/) - Study materials

## Key Takeaways

1. **Cleaner separation:** Book content now has its own dedicated repository
2. **Focused purpose:** This repo is now specifically for website + code/notebooks
3. **No functionality lost:** All educational materials still accessible via website
4. **Better maintainability:** Easier to manage focused components

## Notes for Future Sessions

- The book is no longer in this repository
- Focus work on website development and code maintenance
- All 17 chapters remain fully functional
- Data files and notebooks are still here and operational
- Critical rules from CLAUDE.md still apply (no deletions, stay in directory, maintain logs)
