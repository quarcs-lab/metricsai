## Problem Description

### Issue Reported
User reported "many compilation errors in Chapter 13, and there are missing images."

### Root Cause
All six Chapter 13 images had incorrect file paths:
- **Incorrect:** `{images/ch13_*.png}`
- **Correct:** `{../code_python/images/ch13_*.png}`

The images were missing the `../code_python/` directory prefix, causing LaTeX to fail finding the files.

### Error Messages
```
LaTeX Warning: File `images/ch13_api_distribution.png' not found on input line 278.
! Package pdftex.def Error: File `images/ch13_api_distribution.png' not found: using draft setting.
```

## Implementation Process

### Step 1: Diagnosis
```bash
# Identified the issue
pdflatex main.tex | grep -A 5 "ch13"
# Found 6 missing image file errors
```

### Step 2: Locate Images
```bash
ls -la code_python/images/ch13*.png
# Confirmed all 6 images exist at correct location
```

### Step 3: Fix Paths
Used Edit tool to update each of the 6 image paths:
- Searched for pattern: `{images/ch13_*.png}`
- Replaced with: `{../code_python/images/ch13_*.png}`

### Step 4: Verify Compilation
```bash
pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode main.tex
# Output: 436 pages, 16,443,025 bytes
# Status: Success
```

### Step 5: Verify Images Load
```bash
pdflatex main.tex 2>&1 | grep "ch13.*png"
# All 6 images loaded successfully
```
