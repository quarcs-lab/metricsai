### 5. Added Consolidated Key Takeaways

**Created 10 thematic groups at chapter end:**

**Group 1: Multicollinearity (Section 16.1) (11 bullets)**
- Definition and types (perfect vs. high)
- OLS remains unbiased but imprecise
- Symptoms: high R², few significant t-stats
- Detection methods (VIF, auxiliary regressions)
- Can occur with low pairwise correlations
- Solutions and when to use each
- Example with Age, Education, Experience
- Prediction remains accurate
- Joint F-tests for collinear subsets
- Accept wider intervals when unavoidable
- Not a bias problem, precision problem

**Group 2: OLS Assumptions Revisited (Section 16.2) (12 bullets)**
- Four core assumptions enumerated
- Each assumption's specific purpose
- Assumption 1: correct model (no specification bias)
- Assumption 2: mean zero error (unbiasedness)
- Assumption 3: constant variance (efficiency)
- Assumption 4: independence (no autocorrelation)
- Failures of 1-2: bias and inconsistency
- Failures of 3-4: wrong SE but unbiased
- Mathematical foundation: b = β + Σw_i u_i
- Unbiasedness requires E[u_i|x_i] = 0
- Variance formula requires assumptions 3-4
- Different remedies for different violations

**Group 3: Incorrect Population Model (Section 16.3) (10 bullets)**
- Wrong functional form causes bias
- Omitted variables bias: occurs when omitted affects y AND correlates with x
- Bias formula: E[b₂] = α₂ + α₃γ
- Bias magnitude depends on effect strength and correlation
- Can be positive or negative
- Irrelevant regressors reduce precision but don't bias
- Better to include too many than too few
- Solution: include relevant control variables
- Always ask what might be omitted
- Robustness checks essential

**Group 4: Endogeneity and Regressors Correlated with Errors (Section 16.4) (11 bullets)**
- Definition: x correlated with u
- Causes bias and inconsistency
- Three main sources: omitted variables, measurement error, simultaneity
- Example 1: earnings on schooling (ability omitted)
- Example 2: inflation on money supply (feedback)
- Example 3: measurement error (attenuation bias)
- Solution: instrumental variables (IV)
- Valid instrument: relevant and excluded
- IV formula and intuition
- Example: distance to college
- 2SLS for multiple instruments

**Group 5: Heteroskedasticity (Section 16.5) (11 bullets)**
- Definition: Var[u_i|x_i] varies
- Common in cross-section data
- OLS unbiased but inefficient
- Default SE wrong, invalidating inference
- Detection: residual plots, formal tests
- Fan shape in residual plots
- Primary solution: robust SE
- Always safe to use robust SE
- Alternative: transform y (log)
- Advanced: WLS if can model variance
- Most common: heteroskedastic-robust SE

**Group 6: Autocorrelation (Section 16.6) (12 bullets)**
- Definition: Cov[u_i, u_j] ≠ 0
- Common in time series
- Also clustered errors
- OLS unbiased but inefficient
- Default SE typically too small
- Leads to over-rejection (false positives)
- Clustered errors: within-group correlation
- Solution: cluster-robust SE
- Time series: AR(1) model common
- Solution: HAC standard errors
- Lag length choice: m = 0.75 × T^(1/3)
- Alternative: model dynamics explicitly

**Group 7: Democracy and Growth Example (Section 16.7) (10 bullets)**
- 131 countries, 1500-2000 changes
- Bivariate: positive significant relationship
- Growth coefficient: 0.131 (significant)
- Multiple regression adds controls
- With controls: coefficient falls to 0.047
- 64% reduction demonstrates omitted bias
- Institutions (religion, constraints) matter
- Catholic/Protestant higher democracy
- R² unchanged (controls orthogonal)
- Classic omitted variables bias demonstration

**Group 8: Residual Diagnostic Plots (Section 16.8.1-16.8.2) (12 bullets)**
- Plots reveal violations statistics miss
- y vs. ŷ: overall fit quality
- e vs. ŷ: rotated version
- Fan/cone shape: heteroskedasticity
- U-shape/pattern: wrong functional form
- Random scatter: assumptions satisfied
- Residuals vs. regressor: variable-specific problems
- Component-plus-residual: partial relationship
- Detects nonlinearity in specific x_j
- Added variable plot: pure relationship
- Shows relationship holding others constant
- Slope equals OLS coefficient

**Group 9: Outliers and Influential Observations (Section 16.8.3-16.8.4) (14 bullets)**
- Outlier: unusual value given data
- May be error, extreme, or different population
- Not all outliers influential
- Leverage: distance from mean regressors
- High leverage: potential for influence
- Influential: substantially affects results
- DFITS: influence on fitted values
- Rule: |DFITS| > 2√(k/n)
- DFBETA: influence on coefficients
- Rule: |DFBETA| > 2/√n
- Don't auto-delete—investigate
- Check if error, outlier, or valid extreme
- Residuals ≠ errors (e_i ≠ u_i)
- Residuals depend on x even if errors don't

**Group 10: General Diagnostic Principles (8 bullets)**
- Visual inspection essential
- Check multiple plots to triangulate
- Robustness: re-estimate without influential obs
- Specification tests: alternative forms
- Use appropriate SE always
- When assumptions fail: fix model or use robust inference
- Document all diagnostics
- Transparency builds credibility

**Total: 111 Key Takeaways bullets**
