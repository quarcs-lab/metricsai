## Changes Made

### Phase 0: Remove Emojis
- Removed emojis from 4 cells (7, 12, 15, 33)

### Phase 1: Structure and Learning Objectives
- Enhanced Chapter Overview (cell 1) with 9 formal learning objectives from notes
- Added chapter outline listing sections 17.2-17.7 + Key Takeaways, Practice Exercises, Case Studies
- Datasets in bulleted list format

### Phase 2: Key Concept Boxes (10 total: 8 main + 2 in case study)
1. Panel Data Variation Decomposition (after NBA data loading)
2. Cluster-Robust Standard Errors for Panel Data (after pooled OLS)
3. Fixed Effects -- Controlling for Unobserved Heterogeneity (after FE estimation)
4. Fixed Effects vs. Random Effects (after RE estimation)
5. Time Series Stationarity and Spurious Regression (after time series data)
6. Detecting and Correcting Autocorrelation (after ACF check)
7. First Differencing for Nonstationary Data (after differenced regression)
8. Instrumental Variables and Causal Inference (after causality code)
9. Panel Data for Cross-Country Analysis (case study)
10. Choosing Between Panel Data Estimators (case study)

### Phase 3: Transition Notes (3)
- Between 17.4 and 17.5: panel data -> time series analysis
- Between 17.5 and 17.6: time series basics -> autocorrelation
- Between 17.6 and 17.7: time series -> causal inference

### Phase 4: Key Takeaways
- Replaced Chapter Summary with 5 thematic groups
- Python tools, next steps, congratulations closing

### Phase 5: Practice Exercises (6)
1. Panel Data Variance Decomposition
2. Cluster-Robust Standard Errors
3. Fixed Effects vs. Random Effects
4. Time Series Autocorrelation
5. Spurious Regression
6. Identifying Causal Effects

### Phase 6: Case Studies (Mendez dataset)
