## Chapter 11 Content Coverage

**Section 11.1: Properties of the Least Squares Estimator**
- Data assumption: Variation in sample regressors, no perfect multicollinearity
- Four population model assumptions (correct model, mean-zero errors, homoskedasticity, independence)
- Extension to multiple regressors: E[y|x₂,...,xₖ] = β₁ + β₂x₂ + ... + βₖxₖ
- Properties of least squares estimates (unbiasedness, variance, standard errors)
- Precision factors: good fit, many observations, scattered regressors

**Section 11.2: Estimators of Model Parameters**
- OLS estimator bⱼ properties: unbiased and consistent
- Best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE) under assumptions 1-4
- Best unbiased estimator under assumptions 1-4 plus normality
- Gauss-Markov theorem

**Section 11.3: Confidence Intervals**
- Formula: bⱼ ± t_{n-k,α/2} × se(bⱼ)
- Approximate 95% CI: bⱼ ± 2 × se(bⱼ)
- Example: House price regression with size and five other regressors

**Section 11.4: Tests on Individual Parameters**
- Two-sided tests: H₀: βⱼ = β*ⱼ against Hₐ: βⱼ ≠ β*ⱼ
- Test statistic: t = (bⱼ - β*ⱼ)/se(bⱼ) ~ T(n-k)
- Tests of statistical significance: H₀: βⱼ = 0
- One-sided tests also possible
- Example: House price - Size coefficient test

**Section 11.5: Joint Hypothesis Tests**
- Testing multiple restrictions simultaneously
- F tests and F distribution with two degrees of freedom (v₁, v₂)
- v₁ = number of restrictions (q), v₂ = n-k
- F distribution: right-skewed, positive values only
- Examples: H₀: β₂=0 and β₃=0, H₀: all slopes = 0
- For single restriction: F = t²

**Section 11.6: F Statistic under Assumptions 1-4**
- Formula: F = [(RSSᵣ - RSSᵤ)/q] / [RSSᵤ/(n-k)]
- RSSᵣ = residual sum of squares in restricted model
- RSSᵤ = residual sum of squares in unrestricted model
- Test of overall significance: F = [R²/(k-1)] / [(1-R²)/(n-k)]
- Test of subsets: manual computation using RSS values

**Section 11.7: Presentation of Regression Results**
- Five standard formats for presenting results
- Format 1: Coefficients with standard errors
- Format 2: Coefficients with t-statistics
- Format 3: Coefficients with p-values
- Format 4: Coefficients with confidence intervals
- Format 5: Coefficients with asterisks (*/**/***)
- Always report n, R², F-statistic

## Key Econometric Concepts Covered

### Extension from Bivariate to Multiple Regression
- T(n-k) distribution replaces T(n-2) distribution
- k = total number of regressors including intercept
- Same inference logic but different degrees of freedom
- Individual tests now "control for" other regressors

### F Tests and Joint Hypotheses
- Test multiple restrictions simultaneously
- Cannot use t-tests for joint hypotheses
- F distribution with two degrees of freedom
- Overall significance test: all slopes = 0
- Subset tests: groups of regressors jointly significant

### Multicollinearity and Precision
- Perfect multicollinearity: cannot estimate coefficients
- Imperfect multicollinearity: inflates standard errors
- Variance depends on residuals x̃ⱼᵢ from auxiliary regression
- High correlation among regressors reduces precision

### Properties of OLS in Multiple Regression
- Unbiased: E[bⱼ] = βⱼ (assumptions 1-2)
- Consistent: bⱼ → βⱼ as n → ∞
- BLUE: Best linear unbiased estimator (assumptions 1-4)
- Optimal among linear unbiased estimators (Gauss-Markov)

## Technical Implementation

### Heading Hierarchy Fix
Used batch sed command to fix all headings efficiently:

```bash
cd /Users/carlosmendez/Documents/GitHub/metricsai/notes && sed -i.bak '
# First, change main sections from ### to ## (11.1-11.7)
s/^### 11\.1 Properties of the Least Squares Estimator$/## 11.1 Properties of the Least Squares Estimator/
s/^### 11\.2 Estimators of Model Parameters$/## 11.2 Estimators of Model Parameters/
s/^### 11\.3 Confidence Intervals$/## 11.3 Confidence Intervals/
s/^### 11\.4 Tests on Individual Parameters$/## 11.4 Tests on Individual Parameters/
s/^### 11\.5 Joint Hypothesis Tests$/## 11.5 Joint Hypothesis Tests/
s/^### 11\.6 F Statistic under Assumptions 1-4$/## 11.6 F Statistic under Assumptions 1-4/
s/^### 11\.7 Presentation of Regression Results$/## 11.7 Presentation of Regression Results/

# Then change all remaining ## headings to ### (21 subsections)
s/^## Example for this Chapter with dependent variable price$/### Example for this Chapter with dependent variable price/
s/^## Population Model Assumptions$/### Population Model Assumptions/
# ... (21 total subsections)
' "s11 Statistical Inference for Multiple Regression.md" && rm "s11 Statistical Inference for Multiple Regression.md.bak"
```

Result: All main sections at Level 2, all subsections at Level 3.

## Notes

- Chapter 11 is foundational for understanding statistical inference in multiple regression
- Extends bivariate regression (Chapter 7) to multiple regressors
- Key new concept: F tests for joint hypotheses (cannot use t-tests)
- Critical distinction: T(n-k) distribution for multiple regression vs. T(n-2) for bivariate
- F distribution nests t distribution: F = t² for single restriction
- Template successfully applied to methodological chapter with extensive hypothesis testing content
- Comprehensive Key Takeaways (23 groups, 140+ bullets) - most extensive in entire project
- **FINAL CHAPTER COMPLETED - ALL 17 CHAPTERS NOW IMPROVED!**
