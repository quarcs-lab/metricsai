## Key Concepts Added to CH06

The 6 Key Concept boxes cover the most important OLS theoretical concepts:

1. **Population vs. sample**: True parameters β vs. estimates b, sampling variability
2. **Error vs. residual**: Unobserved u vs. observed e, crucial distinction for inference
3. **Monte Carlo evidence**: Empirical demonstration of unbiasedness and normality
4. **Four assumptions**: Which are essential (1-2) vs. relaxable (3-4)
5. **Standard errors and precision**: Formula, factors affecting precision
6. **BLUE property**: Gauss-Markov Theorem, optimality of OLS

These concepts are foundational for all subsequent econometric theory and practice.

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Exceptionally Well

1. **Established workflow is now mature**
   - Script template is well-tested and reliable
   - Cell insertion logic handles complex notebooks smoothly
   - Verification steps catch any issues immediately

2. **CH06 had excellent base content**
   - Already had clear conceptual structure
   - Monte Carlo simulations provided perfect teaching examples
   - Rich theoretical content made Key Concepts obvious

3. **Efficient execution**
   - Single script run with no iterations needed
   - Clean execution with proper verification
   - 35 minutes start-to-finish (very efficient)

### Chapter-Specific Success

**CH06 is particularly important because:**
- It establishes the **theoretical foundation** for all inference
- Introduces crucial concepts: unbiasedness, consistency, efficiency
- Explains **why OLS works** (not just how to compute it)
- Uses simulations to make abstract theory concrete

The enhancements make these abstract concepts more accessible through:
- Clear Learning Objectives setting expectations
- Key Concepts reinforcing immediately after each major idea
- Practice Exercises testing understanding of theory
- Comprehensive Key Takeaways synthesizing all properties
