## Key Econometric Concepts Covered

### Fundamental Concepts
- Population regression line: β₁ + β₂x
- Sample regression line: b₁ + b₂x
- Error term u (unobserved, population)
- Residual e (observed, sample)
- Conditional mean and variance

### OLS Assumptions
1. Correct model specification: yᵢ = β₁ + β₂xᵢ + uᵢ
2. Mean-zero errors: E[uᵢ|xᵢ] = 0
3. Homoskedasticity: Var[uᵢ|xᵢ] = σ²ᵤ
4. Independence: uᵢ independent of uⱼ

### Statistical Properties
- **Unbiasedness**: E[b₂] = β₂ (under assumptions 1-2)
- **Consistency**: b₂ → β₂ as n → ∞
- **Efficiency**: OLS is BLUE (Best Linear Unbiased Estimator)
- **Normality**: (b₂ - β₂)/σ_b₂ ~ N(0,1) for large n (CLT)

### Precision Metrics
- Variance of b₂: Var[b₂] = σ²ᵤ / Σ(xᵢ-x̄)²
- Standard error: se(b₂) = sₑ / √[Σ(xᵢ-x̄)²]
- Standard error of regression: sₑ = √[Σeᵢ²/(n-2)]

### Factors Affecting Precision
1. Good model fit (small σ²ᵤ) → smaller variance
2. More observations (large n) → smaller variance
3. Scattered regressors (large Σ(xᵢ-x̄)²) → smaller variance

## Technical Implementation

### Batch Heading Fix Command
Used single sed command to fix 27 subsections efficiently:

```bash
sed -i.bak '
s/^### 6\.2 Examples of Sampling from a Population$/## 6.2 Examples of Sampling from a Population/
s/^### 6\.3 Properties of the Least Squares Estimator$/## 6.3 Properties of the Least Squares Estimator/
s/^### 6\.4 Estimators of Model Parameters$/## 6.4 Estimators of Model Parameters/
s/^## Population Conditional Mean (continued)$/### Population Conditional Mean (continued)/
s/^## Error Term$/### Error Term/
s/^## The Conditional Variance$/### The Conditional Variance/
s/^## Sampling from the Population Model$/### Sampling from the Population Model/
# ... [27 total substitutions]
' "s06 The Least Squares Estimator.md" && rm "s06 The Least Squares Estimator.md.bak"
```

Result: All subsections correctly changed to Level 3, main sections preserved at Level 2.
