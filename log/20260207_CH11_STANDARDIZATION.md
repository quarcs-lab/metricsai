## Changes Made

### Phase 1: Structure & Learning Objectives
- Enhanced Chapter Overview (cell 1) with 10 formal learning objectives from notes
- Added chapter outline listing sections 11.1-11.7 + Key Takeaways, Practice Exercises, Case Studies

### Phase 2: Key Concept Boxes (10 total: 8 main + 2 in case study)
1. Classical Assumptions for Statistical Inference (after 11.1 code)
2. Precision of Coefficient Estimates (after model diagnostics code)
3. Confidence Intervals in Multiple Regression (after CI table code)
4. Tests of Statistical Significance (after t-test code)
5. Joint Hypothesis Tests and the F Distribution (after subset F-test code)
6. The F Statistic Under Homoskedasticity (after manual F-stat code)
7. Testing Subsets of Regressors (after ANOVA table code)
8. Robust Standard Errors and Heteroskedasticity (after robust SEs code)
9. Statistical Significance in Cross-Country Regressions (case study)
10. From Statistical Significance to Policy Relevance (case study)

### Phase 3: Transition Notes (3)
- Between 11.2 and 11.3: OLS properties → confidence intervals
- Between 11.4 and 11.5: individual tests → joint hypothesis tests
- Between 11.6 and 11.7: F-statistics → presenting results

### Phase 4: Key Takeaways
- Replaced Chapter Summary with template-formatted Key Takeaways
- 6 thematic groups: Classical Assumptions, Confidence Intervals, Individual Tests, Joint F-Tests, Model Comparison, Presenting Results
- Python tools, next steps, congratulations closing

### Phase 5: Practice Exercises (6)
1. Confidence Interval Calculation
2. Test of Statistical Significance
3. Testing a Specific Value
4. Joint F-Test Setup
5. F-Statistic Computation
6. Regression Presentation

### Phase 6: Case Studies (Mendez dataset)
- Case Study: Statistical Inference for Cross-Country Productivity
- Dataset: Mendez Convergence Clubs (108 countries, 1990-2014)
- 6 progressive tasks (Guided → Independent):
  1. Estimate Productivity Model (Guided)
  2. Confidence Intervals (Guided)
  3. Individual Hypothesis Tests (Semi-guided)
  4. Joint F-Test (Semi-guided)
  5. Model Comparison (Independent)
  6. Inference Policy Brief (Independent)
- 2 embedded Key Concepts
- "What You've Learned" closing

|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Compliance score | 49/100 | 95/100 | 85-93 |
| Total cells | 60 | 83 | 45-75 |
| Markdown cells | 37 (62%) | 60 (72%) | 70-80% |
| Key Concepts | 0 | 10 | 7-11 |
| Practice Exercises | 0 | 6 | 6-10 |
| Case Study tasks | 0 | 6 | 6 |
| Transition notes | 0 | 3 | 2-4 |

## Remaining Minor Issues

1. "Integrated case study structure" — False positive (standard for chapters with 4+ early sections)
2. "Total cell count too high: 83" — Expected for a chapter with 7 content sections and extensive interpretation cells
