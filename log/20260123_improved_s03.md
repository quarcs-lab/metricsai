## Chapter 3 Coverage

### Main Topics (8 sections)

**3.1 Random Variables:**
- Definition of random variables and experiments
- Notation: upper case for RVs, lower case for realizations
- Mean (expected value): $\mu = \mathrm{E}[X]$
- Variance: $\sigma^2 = \mathrm{E}[(X-\mu)^2]$
- Standard deviation: $\sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2}$
- Coin toss examples (fair and unfair)

**3.2 Random Samples:**
- Sample values as realizations of random variables
- Sample mean $\bar{x}$ as realization of $\bar{X}$
- Sample variance and standard deviation
- $n-1$ divisor for unbiased variance estimation

**3.3 Sample Generated from an Experiment: Coin Tosses:**
- 400 samples of size 30 from coin tosses
- Distribution of sample means (approximately normal)
- Mean of sample means ≈ population mean
- SD of sample means << population SD
- Empirical demonstration of sampling variability

**3.4 Properties of the Sample Mean:**
- Simple random sampling assumptions (A-C): common mean, common variance, independence
- Mean of sample mean: $\mathrm{E}[\bar{X}] = \mu$ (unbiasedness)
- Variance of sample mean: $\operatorname{Var}[\bar{X}] = \sigma^2/n$ (precision increases with $n$)
- Proofs using linearity and independence
- Central Limit Theorem: $Z = (\bar{X}-\mu)/(\sigma/\sqrt{n}) \sim N(0,1)$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$
- Approximate normality: $\bar{X} \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2/n)$ for large $n$
- Standard error: se($\bar{X}$) = $s/\sqrt{n}$ (estimated SD of sample mean)

**3.5 Sampling from a Population: 1880 Census:**
- Population: 50+ million people, $\mu = 24.13$ years, $\sigma = 18.61$ years
- Non-normal population (age distribution)
- Single sample results close but not equal to parameters
- 100 sample means approximately normal despite non-normal population
- Empirical validation of CLT

**3.6 Estimation of the Sample Mean:**
- Terminology: parameter, estimator, estimate
- Unbiased estimators: $\mathrm{E}[\bar{X}] = \mu$
- Consistent estimators: converge to parameter as $n \rightarrow \infty$
- Efficient estimators: minimum variance among unbiased estimators
- Sample mean satisfies all three properties (unbiased, consistent, efficient)

**3.7 Samples other than Simple Random Samples:**
- Representative but dependent samples (adjust se formula)
- Nonrepresentative samples (different observations, different means)
- Weighted means: $w_i = 1/\pi_i$ where $\pi_i$ is inclusion probability
- Weighted mean formula: $\bar{x}_w = [\sum w_i x_i] / [\sum w_i]$

**3.8 Computer Generation of a Random Variable:**
- Pseudo-random number generators (uniform [0,1])
- Simulating coin tosses and population sampling
- Importance of setting seed for reproducibility
- Stata example code for generating 400 sample means

## Next Steps

### Remaining Chapters to Improve (3 of 17)
- Chapter 6 (s06)
- Chapter 7 (s07)
- Chapter 11 (s11)

### Completed Chapters (14 of 17)
✅ Chapter 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17

**Progress:** 82% complete (14/17 chapters improved)

## Implementation Notes

1. **Batch processing:** Used single `sed` command to fix all 32 heading level changes efficiently
2. **Strategic Key Concepts:** Placed boxes after fundamental results (RV properties, sample mean distribution, CLT, standard error, estimator properties, weighting)
3. **Comprehensive Takeaways:** 15 groups provide complete review organized by logical flow
4. **Mathematical rigor:** Chapter includes formal proofs (mean/variance of sample mean) - Key Takeaways summarize without reproducing full derivations
5. **Dual examples:** Both experimental (coin tosses) and real-world (Census) data illustrate concepts
6. **Estimation theory:** Full coverage of unbiasedness, consistency, and efficiency
7. **Extensions:** Addresses violations of simple random sampling assumptions
