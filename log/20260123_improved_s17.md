- Cluster-robust standard errors for grouped observations
- Panel data methods (pooled OLS, random effects, fixed effects)
- Within and between variation decomposition
- Fixed effects control for time-invariant characteristics

- IV formula: b_IV = Σ(z_i - z̄)(y_i - ȳ) / Σ(z_i - z̄)(x_i - x̄)
- Intuition: ratio of reduced forms (Δy/Δz) / (Δx/Δz)
- Two-stage least squares (2SLS) for multiple endogenous regressors
- Example: distance to college as instrument for schooling
- First-stage F-statistic tests instrument relevance

**Group 3: Causal Inference Framework (9 bullets)**

- Regression of log(revenue) on wins and year dummies
- Pooled OLS: one more win increases revenue by 0.27%
- Random effects: similar results with cluster-robust SE
- Fixed effects: controls for team-specific factors (market size, arena)
- Fixed effects coefficient slightly larger (0.30%)
- Hausman test compares fixed vs. random effects
- Interpretation: winning matters for revenue even controlling for team characteristics

**Section 17.4: Instrumental Variables**
- IV addresses endogeneity: E[u|x] ≠ 0
- Valid instrument requirements:
  1. Relevance: Cov(z,x) ≠ 0
  2. Exclusion restriction: Cov(z,u) = 0
- IV estimator: b_IV = Σ(z_i - z̄)(y_i - ȳ) / Σ(z_i - z̄)(x_i - x̄)
- Intuition: ratio of reduced forms (Δy/Δz) / (Δx/Δz)
- Two-stage least squares (2SLS) for multiple instruments
- First-stage regression tests instrument relevance
- Example: distance to college as instrument for education in wage equations
- Weak instruments: first-stage F < 10 indicates problems

**Section 17.5: Causal Inference: An Overview**
- Potential outcomes framework: Y_1i (treated), Y_0i (untreated)
- Individual treatment effect: Y_1i - Y_0i (unobservable)
- Average treatment effect (ATE): E[Y_1i - Y_0i]
- Average treatment effect on treated (ATET): E[Y_1i - Y_0i | D_i = 1]
- Randomized control trials (RCTs):
  - Random assignment ensures E[Y_0i | D_i=1] = E[Y_0i | D_i=0]
  - Simple difference estimator is unbiased for ATE
  - Gold standard for causal inference
- Difference-in-differences (DiD):
  - Natural experiments with treatment and control groups
  - Controls for time trends: (Ȳ_post - Ȳ_pre)_treatment - (Ȳ_post - Ȳ_pre)_control
  - Parallel trends assumption
  - Example: minimum wage effects on employment
- Regression adjustment:
  - Add control variables X to RCT or DiD

  - Can address imbalances in randomization
- Regression discontinuity design (RDD):
  - Treatment assigned based on threshold rule
  - Compare outcomes just above and below cutoff
  - Local causal estimate near threshold
  - Uses flexible polynomials or nonparametric methods

  - Propensity score: p̂_i = Pr(D_i=1 | X_i)
  - Selection on observables assumption
  - Balances treatment and control groups
- Matching methods:

  - Ensures probabilities between 0 and 1
  - S-shaped probability curve
  - Marginal effects: ME_j ≤ 0.25 × |b_j|
- Probit model for binary outcomes:
  - Pr[y=1|x] = Φ(β'x) where Φ is standard normal CDF
  - Similar to logit, slightly different tails
  - Marginal effects: ME_j ≤ 0.4 × |b_j|
- Exponential conditional mean model:
  - For nonnegative data: E[y|x] = exp(β'x)
  - Coefficients are semi-elasticities: 100×β percent change

- Autocorrelation: correlation between y_t and y_{t-s}
- HAC standard errors account for autocorrelation
- Stationarity requirement:
  - Constant mean: E[y_t] = μ
  - Constant variance: Var(y_t) = σ²
  - Covariances depend only on lag: Cov(y_t, y_{t-s}) = γ_s
- Nonstationary series can lead to spurious regression
- Unit root tests: Dickey-Fuller, Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF)
- If nonstationary, use first differences: Δy_t = y_t - y_{t-1}
- Autoregressive (AR) models: y_t = β_0 + β_1 y_{t-1} + ... + u_t
- Distributed lag models: y_t = β_0 + β_1 x_t + β_2 x_{t-1} + ... + u_t
- ARDL: combines AR and distributed lag
- Forecasting methods: AR, ARMA, VAR
- Time series econometrics is a specialized field
