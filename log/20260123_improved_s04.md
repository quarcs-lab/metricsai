## Chapter 4 Coverage

### Section-by-Section Summary:

**4.1 Example: Mean Annual Earnings:**
- Sample of 171 female workers aged 30 in 2010
- Mean earnings $41,413, standard deviation $25,527
- Standard error $1,952
- 95% confidence interval: ($37,559, $45,266)
- Hypothesis test H₀: μ = $40,000 yields t = 0.724, p = 0.470 → do not reject
- Introduces key concepts used throughout chapter

**4.2 t Statistic and t Distribution:**
- Simple random sample properties: E[x̄] = μ, Var[x̄] = σ²/n
- Central Limit Theorem: (x̄ - μ)/(σ/√n) ~ N(0,1) as n → ∞
- Replace σ with s to get t-statistic: t = (x̄ - μ)/(s/√n)
- t distribution with (n-1) degrees of freedom
- Fatter tails than standard normal, converges to N(0,1) as df increases
- Exact if data normal, approximation otherwise
- Probabilities and inverse probabilities using software

**4.3 Confidence Intervals:**
- 95% CI: x̄ ± t_{n-1,0.025} × se(x̄)
- General 100(1-α)% CI: x̄ ± t_{n-1,α/2} × (s/√n)
- Derivation from first principles
- Trade-off between confidence level and interval width
- Critical values table for 90%, 95%, 99% confidence
- Two-standard-error rule for large samples
- Interpretation: 95% of such intervals contain μ

**4.4 Two-Sided Hypothesis Tests:**
- H₀: μ = μ* vs. H_a: μ ≠ μ*
- Significance level α and Type I error
- Test statistic: t = (x̄ - μ*)/(s/√n)
- P-value: p = Pr[|T_{n-1}| ≥ |t|]
- P-value approach: reject if p < α
- Critical value approach: reject if |t| > t_{n-1,α/2}
- Relationship to confidence intervals
- Summary table showing both approaches

**4.5 Hypothesis Testing Examples:**
- Example 1 - Gasoline prices: Reject H₀ (t=-5.256, p=0.000)
- Example 2 - Male earnings: Do not reject H₀ (t=0.500, p=0.310)
- Example 3 - GDP growth: Do not reject H₀ (t=-0.068, p=0.946)
- Demonstrates applications across different contexts

**4.6 One-sided Directional Hypothesis Tests:**
- Upper tail: H₀: μ ≤ μ* vs. H_a: μ > μ*
- Lower tail: H₀: μ ≥ μ* vs. H_a: μ < μ*
- Claim specified as alternative hypothesis
- P-values and critical regions for one-sided tests
- Example: testing if earnings exceed $40,000
- Why claims go in H_a: require strong evidence

**4.7 Generalize Confidence Intervals and Hypothesis Tests:**
- General t-statistic: (estimate - parameter) / standard error
- General CI: estimate ± t_{v,α/2} × standard error
- General hypothesis test procedures
- Margin of error ≈ 2 × standard error for 95% CIs
- Extension to other parameters beyond the mean

**4.8 Proportions Data:**
- Binary data: x_i = 1 or 0
- Sample mean equals sample proportion
- Special variance formula: s² = nx̄(1-x̄)/(n-1)
- CI standard error: √[x̄(1-x̄)/n]
- Test standard error: √[p*(1-p*)/n] for H₀: p = p*
- Example: 480 of 921 voters → proportion 0.5212

**Additional Materials:**
- Key Stata commands for all procedures
