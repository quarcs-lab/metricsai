# Images

This directory contains image assets for the metricsAI project.

## Current Files

- **cover.jpg** - Cover image for the project, displayed on the main README and website

## Generated Figures

When running the Jupyter notebooks, visualizations and plots are generated dynamically within the notebooks themselves. No image files need to be stored locally as all figures are created inline using matplotlib and seaborn.

## Usage

The cover image is referenced in:

- Main README.md: `![](images/cover.jpg)`
- Project documentation
- Website homepage

All other data visualizations (scatter plots, histograms, regression plots, etc.) are created on-the-fly in the interactive notebooks and do not require pre-generated image files.
